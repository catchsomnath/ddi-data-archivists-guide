Independent quality review
================

An independent review of the data and metadata is highly recommended prior to publishing the final output. The Appendix provides a blank review form (the DDI Reviewerâ€™s Feedback Form) to be used by an external reviewer. The IHSN can assist in identifying external reviewers.

The external review can be based on:
1.	The DDI file (xml file, containing no microdata and no external resources)
2.	The Nesstar file (containing microdata and DDI/DCMI metadata)
3.	The CD-ROM (or website), without microdata
4.	The CD-ROM (or website), with microdata

The preferred option is the last one, as it allows a full check of the final output. If data are highly confidential and cannot be shared with the reviewer, option 3 is the most appropriate. 

In order to prepare for the independent quality review, proceed to step 10 if you will use options three or four.  Follow the guidance there, and then finalize the archiving before producing the final output.  Else, send the DDI-XML or the Nesstar file to the reviewer.
