5.4. Good practices for completing the Variables Description

The Variable Description is the section of the DDI document that provides detailed information on each variable.

                    These are the names given to the variables. Ideally, the variable names should be a maximum of 8 characters, and use a logical naming
                    convention (e.g., section (S) and question (Q) numbers to name the question). If the variable names do not follow these principles, DO NOT
                    CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAMES IN THE TOOLKIT, but make recommendations to the data processor for consideration for future surveys.

                    information, in order to allow users to export the data to ASCII fixed format. To do so, use the "Variables &gt; Resequence" command in the
                    Toolkit, for each data file.

                    Variable categories are the lists of codes (and their meaning) that apply to the variable. The Toolkit imports categories and their labels
                    from the source data files (SPSS, Stata).

                <p>
                    If necessary, add/edit the codes. Use the Documentation &gt; Create categories from statistics if the source dataset did not include value
                    labels (e,g., when imported from ASCII). Make sure the categories are not hierarchical, and do not include codes for "Missing". The codes
                    for Missing must be specified in the "Missing data" field. If you fail to do that, the summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc)
                    will be calculated including the missing code, which will be considered as a valid value.

                    Four types of variables are recognized by the Toolkit:

                <li>Fixed string:
                    <em>
                        A fixed string variable has a predefined length (default length is 8 but it can range from 1 to 255 characters in length) which enables the publisher to handle this data type more efficiently.
                    </em></li>
					<li>Dynamic string: <em>Dynamic string variables can be used to store open-ended questions.</em></li>
					<li>Date: <em>date variables stored in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD?â€”should specify)</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The data type is usually properly identified when the data is imported. It is important to avoid the use of string variables when this is not absolutely needed. Such issues must be taken care of before the data is imported in the Toolkit. See the section on "<a href="#_Gathering_and_preparing">Gathering and preparing the dataset</a>" above.

                    The Microdata Management Toolkit will allow you to define the measure of a variable as:

                    Female = 1). When variables are nominal, we can produce frequency tables by code, but calculating mean or standard deviation of the codes
                    would not make sense.

                    Allows modifying the minimum value of a variable. For each variable where it makes sense, you should check that the Min and Max values are
                    correct. Remember: if a specific value is used for "Missing", this should not be included in the Min-Max range. For example, if codes 1 and
                    2 are used for Male and Female, and 9 for unknown sex, then the Min will be 1 and the Max will be 2. The code 9 must be listed in the

                    Various options exist for displaying and presenting summary information of the variable to the user or the person browsing the output.
                    Summary statistics are saved in the DDI document and become part of the metadata. It is therefore important to select the appropriate ones.

                <ul>
                    <li>For nominal variables you want to be sure that the categories are well defined and that some of the summary statistics are not displayed(such as means and standard deviations.
                <li>For ordinal values, you want to be sure that the categories are displayed if they are required. Not all ordinal values will require a category. In some cases you may want to include some summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation.
                <li>For scale values, you do not want to define categories and you may want to include some summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure you do not include "Frequencies" for variables such as the household identification number or enumeration area. This would
                    produce a useless frequency table, that would considerably increase the size of your DDI file (in general, a very large DDI fileâ€“8 to 10Mb
                    or moreâ€“ indicates such a problem).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure also that you do not include meaningless summary statistics, such as the mean or standard deviation calculated on the codes used
                    for variable SEX.

                <ul>
                    <li>Summary statistics such as the mean or standard deviation are calculated using all valid values. If special codes are used to indicate
                    missing values, make sure they are declared in the "Missing" section. If not, they will be included in the calculations. For example, if
                    you use code 99999 for indicating missing values in a variable on household expenditure, code 99999 must be listed in the missing section
                    as follows:

                <li>
                    If you modify information such as the categories or missing values, you must use the "Documentation > Update Statistics" command in
                    the Toolkit to refresh the summary statistics.

                    Greater description on the nature of the variable can be placed in this element. For example this element can provide a clearer definition
                    for certain variables (i.e. a variable that provides information on whether a person is a household member). In the case of household
                    membership, a conceptual definition can be provided.

                        A household member is defined as any person who has been resident in the household for six months or more in a given year and takes
                        meals together OR by default the head of household, infants under 6 months, newly wedded couples etc.

                <p> The <em>pre-question texts </em>are the instructions provided to the interviewers and printed in the questionnaire before the literal question. This does not apply to all variables. Do not confuse this with instructions provided in the interviewerâ€™s manual.

                    The <em>literal question</em> is the full text of the questionnaire as the enumerator is expected to ask it when conducting the interview.

					The <em>post-question texts</em> are instructions provided to the interviewers, printed in the questionnaire after the literal question</u>. Post-question can be used to enter information on skips provided in the
                    questionnaire. This does not apply to all variables. Do not confuse this with instructions provided in the interviewerâ€™s manual. With this

                    This element applies to data that were obtained by recoding collected variables, or by calculating new variables that were not directly
                    obtained from data collection. It is very important to properly document such variables. Poorly documented variables cannot (or should not)
                    be used by researchers. In cases where the recoding or derivation method was very simple, a full description can be provided here. For
                    example, if variable AGE_GRP was obtained by recoding variable S1Q3, we could simply mention
                    <em>
                        "Variable obtained by recoding the age in years provided in variable S1Q3 into age groups for years 0-4, 5-9, â€¦, 60-64, 65 and over.

                    household budget survey. In such case, the information provided here could be:
