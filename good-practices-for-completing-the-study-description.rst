                    The version description should contain a version number followed by a version label. The version number should follow a standard convention
                    to be adopted by the institute. We recommend that larger series be defined by a number to the left of a decimal and iterations of the same
                    series by a sequential number that identifies the release. Larger series will typically include (0) the raw, unedited dataset; (1) the
                    edited dataset, non anonymized, for internal use at the data producing agency; and (2) the edited dataset, prepared for dissemination to
                    secondary users (possibly anonymized).

                        Data entry was conducted by 12 data entry operators in tow shifts, supervised by 2 data entry supervisors, using a total of 7 computers
                        (6 data entry computers plus one supervisorsâ€™ computer). All data entry was conducted at the GenCenStat head office using manual data
                        entry. For data entry, CSPro version 2.6.007 was used with a highly structured data entry program, using system controlled approach
                        that controlled entry of each variable. All range checks and skips were controlled by the program and operators could not override
                        these. A limited set of consistency checks were also included in the data entry program. In addition, the calculation of anthropometric
                        Z-scores was also included in the data entry programs for use during analysis. Open-ended responses ("Other" answers) were not entered
                        or coded, except in rare circumstances where the response matched an existing code in the questionnaire.

                    For sampling surveys, it is good practice to calculate and publish sampling error. This field is used to provide information on these

                        Estimates from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: 1) non-sampling errors and 2) sampling errors. Non-sampling errors
                        are the results of mistakes made in the implementation of data collection and data processing. Numerous efforts were made during
                        implementation of the 2005-2006 MICS to minimize this type of error, however, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult
                        to evaluate statistically.

                        If the sample of respondents had been a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulae for
                        calculating sampling errors. However, the 2005-2006 MICS sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and consequently
                        needs to use more complex formulae. The SPSS complex samples module has been used to calculate sampling errors for the 2005-2006 MICS.
                        This module uses the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. This method
                        is documented in the SPSS file CSDescriptives.pdf found under the Help, Algorithms options in SPSS.

                    requirement. This will guarantee that the data producer gets proper credit, and that analytical results can be linked to the proper version
                    of the dataset. The Access Policy should explicitly mention the obligation to comply with the citation requirement (in the example above,
                    see item 5). The citation should include at least the primary investigator, the name and abbreviation of the dataset, the reference year,
                    and the version number. Include also a website where the data or information on the data is made available by the official data depositor.

                    Users of the data may need further clarification and information. This section may include the name-affiliation-email-URI of one or
                    multiple contact persons. Avoid putting the name of individuals. The information provided here should be valid for the long term. It is
                    therefore preferable to identify contact persons by a title. The same applies for the email field. Ideally, a "generic" email address
                    should be provided. It is easy to configure a mail server in such a way that all messages sent to the generic email address would be
                    automatically forwarded to some staff members.
