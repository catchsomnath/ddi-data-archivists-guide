Completing metadata
================

The IHSN Toolkit (version 1.n) makes use of the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI Version 2) and the Dublin Core (DCMI version X) metadata standards. 

A thorough completion of the DDI and DCMI elements will significantly raise the value of the archiving work by providing users with the necessary information to put the study into its proper context and to understand its purpose. 

The DDI requires completion of the following sections: Document Description, Study Description, Data Files Description, Variables Description, and External Resources Description. Recommendations for each field included in the IHSN template are provided below. 
	
.. topic:: Recommendations 

		The IHSN recommends using the standardized IHSN DDI/DCMI templates (Study Template and External Resources Template). This Quick Reference Guide is based on these two templates. Visit the IHSN website to download the latest version of these templates, available in multiple languages.

Overall recommendations:

*	As an archivist, you may need to seek assistance from key experts involved in some of the technical aspects of the survey. 
*	As a general rule, avoid using ALL CAPS when you fill DDI fields. Also, check the spelling of all entries. The Toolkit does not provide (yet) an automatic spell checker.
*	Some of the examples below present an optimal documentation of some fields. In many cases, for past surveys, you will not find such detailed information. Try to provide as much detail as possible. For future surveys, the information should be compiled and provided during the whole life cycle of the survey. This will ensure that the best possible documentation is available at completion of that survey.
