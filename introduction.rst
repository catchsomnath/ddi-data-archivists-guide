This Quick Reference Guide for Data Archivists provides data archivists with guidelines to document a micro-dataset in compliance with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and the Dublin Core (DCMI) metadata standards, using the Microdata Management Toolkit provided by the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) [#f1]_. It summarizes the process in 10 chronological steps: 

1.	Gathering and preparing the data set
2.	Gathering and preparing the documentation
3.	Importing data and establishing relationships
4.	Importing external resources 
5.	Adding metadata 
6.	Creating variable groups (optional)
7.	Running diagnostics
8.	Generating the standard survey documentation using the PDF generator
9.	Quality assessment
10.	Producing the output for publication 

Also provided (in appendix) is the IHSN DDI Reviewers’ Feedback Form which provides a standard tool for the assessment of survey metadata by an external reviewer. 

This Guide is not an IHSN Toolkit reference or training manual. It is assumed that users are already familiar with the Toolkit. A Toolkit User’s Guide is available at www.surveynetwork.org/toolkit.

Before you start: organizing your files
---------------------------------------------

Documentation of a dataset will be considerably facilitated if you organize your data and other files properly. We recommend that, before anything else, you create the necessary directories as follows:

*	Create a directory for the survey. We suggest you name it using the survey’s abbreviated name and year, e.g. “HIES2007” for “Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2007”
*	Create various sub-directories for the data files (and for the various versions of the dataset if relevant)
*	Create sub-directories for the documentation and for the program files if relevant (see example).


.. [#f1]  DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) and DCMI (Dublin Core Metadata Initiative) are international XML metadata specifications. For more information on these standards and on the IHSN Toolkit, please visit www.surveynetwork.org.
