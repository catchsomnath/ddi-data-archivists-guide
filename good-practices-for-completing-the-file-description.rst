5.3. Good practices for completing the File Description
===============

The File Description is the DDI section that aims to provide a detailed description of each data file. The IHSN has selected six of the available DDI elements.

                    A data filename usually provides little information on its content. Provide here a description of this content. This description should
                    clearly distinguish collected variables and derived variables. It is also useful to indicate the availability in the data file of some
                    particular variables such as the weighting coefficients. If the file contains derived variables, it is good practice to refer to the
                    computer program that generated it.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            The file contains data related to section 3A of the household survey questionnaire (Education of household members aged 6 to 24
                            years). It also contains the weighting coefficient, and various recoded variables on levels of education.
                        </em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            The file contains derived data on household consumption, annualized and aggregated by category of products and services. The file
                            also contains a regional price deflator variable and the household weighting coefficient. The file was generated using a Stata
                            program named "cons_aggregate.do" available in the external resources.
                        </em>

                    Put the name of the agency that produced the data file. Most data files will have been produced by the survey primary investigator. In some
                    cases however, auxiliary or derived files from other producers may be released with a data set. This may for example include CPI data
                    generated by a different agency, or files containing derived variables generated by a researcher.

                    A data file may undergo various changes and modifications. These file specific versions can be tracked in this element. This field will in
                    most cases be left empty. It is more important to fill the field identifying the version of the dataset (see above).

                    Use this element if needed to provide information about the types of checks and operations that have been performed on the data file to
                    make sure that the data are as correct as possible, e.g. consistency checking, wildcode checking, etc. Note that the information included
                    here should be specific to the data file. Information about data processing checks that have been carried out on the data collection
                    (study) as a whole should be provided in the "Data editing" element at the study level.

                    You may also provide here a reference to an external resource that contains the specifications for the data processing checks (that same
                    information may be provided also in the "Data Editing" filed in the Study Description section).

                    Missing data can be given certain coding. A common convention is to iterate the number "9" to fill a field. This value needs to be defined
                    as missing in the data set and can be explained in detail in this element.
