Producing the final output
================

Once you are confident that all necessary checks have been completed, you may generate the final output using the CD-ROM Builder module of the IHSN Toolkit. This includes the CD-ROM and survey website. 

Before you generate the CD-ROM:

1.	Make sure you have a customized "branding" for the CD-ROM. If you don’t, design a branding (instructions are provided in the Toolkit User’s Guide).
2.	Prepare content for the "Home page" of the CD-ROM. Typically, a statement by the Director of the data producing agency, or a brief summary of the objectives and findings of the survey, will be generated. 

Generate the CD-ROM with the appropriate options. The IHSN recommends:

1.	To generate the CD-ROM without data
2.	To export all datasets to ASCII format, and to include the zipped ASCII files on the CD-ROM, together with the syntax file to export the data to SPSS, Stata and other formats (which shoulod be provided as external resources). The ASCII format is more standard than the Toolkit Nesstar format, and is a guarantee of long-term viability of your data files.
3.	To include an autorun file.
4.	To include all external resources. 
5.	To check that the CD-ROM outline does not include any empty pages (use the Toolkit utility to check)
6.	To name the CD-ROM according to the dataset abbreviation and version.

After you generate the CD-ROM:

7.	Check all links before you replicate it, in particular the ones to external resources.
8.	Test the autorun.

If your agency has a website, you may upload the content of the CD-ROM directly to the web server. The IHSN recommends the use of a proper DDI-compliant cataloguing system, such as the one provided by its National Data Archive (NADA) application. NADA is an open source package, available free of charge at www.surveynetwork.org.
